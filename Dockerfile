# Self-hosted container for the Metaball Studio editor (metaball.namche.ai).
#
# Multi-stage build: the `build` stage has the full workspace (all
# devDependencies, TypeScript, Vite) and produces editor/dist (the built
# Vite app) and editor/dist-server (the compiled Node server + api/lib
# handlers). `npm prune --omit=dev` then drops devDependencies from that
# same install in place -- workspace-local packages (@namche/metaball,
# @namche/metaball-react) resolve via npm workspace symlinks, not the
# registry, so pruning an already-resolved install avoids re-resolving them
# from scratch in a slim stage. The `runtime` stage copies only the pruned
# node_modules and the two build outputs into a fresh, smaller image and
# runs as a non-root user.
