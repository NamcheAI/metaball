# Metaball Brandmark Editor

An interactive generator for the Namche metaball vocabulary. It opens on the
current **Namche Loop** mark; the approved earlier vector remains available as
**Classic Mark**. Place
variable-size nodes on a 5×5 grid (pink outer ring, blue inner 3×3 canvas),
connect them, and render the result either as a **graph** (circles + connectors)
or as organic **metaballs** (gooey blend). Export to SVG, PNG, or JSON. A
**3D view** shows the same mark as a live, orbitable isosurface with a choice
of organic material presets.

The compact Studio chrome uses the private tool lockup and local Namche Shadow
display face. Its Basalt header mark and Rhododendron favicon are synced from
the authoritative sibling `design` repository's generated brand-asset bundle;
the public “Frontier AI Initiative” descriptor is intentionally omitted to keep
the internal editor header compact.

For finishes that cannot be simulated convincingly in a lightweight browser
shader, Studio can send the current camera view plus an optional material
reference to a server-side image model and return a high-fidelity material
study. This is pay-per-render API usage; no provider credential enters the
browser bundle.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # start the dev server
npm run build    # type-check + production build
npm run preview  # preview the production build
```

## The editor is public

Metaball Studio has no authentication. There is no login, no PIN, no gate in
front of any route. Anyone who can reach a deployment can open it and use it.
(Jodok, 2026-08-25: the editor deploys as a public container at
metaball.namche.ai; an earlier Vercel PIN gate and the Vercel deployment path
itself have both been removed entirely — the self-hosted container is now the
only way this editor ships.)

> **`/api/render` spends real money.** It calls a paid OpenAI image endpoint
> on every request, and since the editor is public, anyone who can reach a
> deployment can trigger it. The server caps this at `RENDER_MAX_PER_HOUR`
> renders per client IP per hour (default 10, `0` disables the guard) — a
> spending brake, not authentication. The limiter keys on the raw socket
> address unless `TRUST_PROXY=1` declares a trusted reverse proxy in front
> (see the environment variables below). See
> [`../docs/AI_RENDERING.md`](../docs/AI_RENDERING.md).

### Local development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to try AI
material renders while iterating on the UI — the Vite dev server has its own
lightweight `/api/render` route for this. It does not run the rate limiter,
health check, or static file server: to exercise the actual self-hosted
server (the one described below), build it and run it directly:

```bash
npm run build                            # from the repo root
npm run serve -w metaball-editor         # node dist-server/server/index.js
```

See [`../docs/AI_RENDERING.md`](../docs/AI_RENDERING.md) for the render
pipeline and code boundaries.

## Self-hosted container

The editor ships as a plain Docker image, built from the repo-root
`Dockerfile`, with a small Node server at [`server/`](server) that serves the
built `dist/` app and the `/api/render` and `/api/health` routes — there is
no separate serverless deployment target any more.

### Build and run

```bash
# from the repo root
docker build -t metaball-editor .
docker run -p 8080:8080 metaball-editor
```

or locally without Docker, after `npm run build`:

```bash
npm run build:server -w metaball-editor   # compiles server/ + lib/ to dist-server/
npm run serve -w metaball-editor          # node dist-server/server/index.js
```

### Environment variables

| Name                        | Value                                                          |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                      | Port to listen on (default `8080`)                               |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`            | Optional server-only key for AI material renders (see warning above) |
| `OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL`        | Optional model override (default `gpt-image-2`)                   |
| `RENDER_MAX_PER_HOUR`       | Renders allowed per client IP per hour (default `10`, `0` = unlimited) |
| `TRUST_PROXY`               | Set to `1` behind a trusted reverse proxy that rewrites `X-Forwarded-For`; otherwise the limiter keys on the socket address (the header is client-forgeable) |

`GET /api/health` always returns `200 {"ok":true}`, for the deploy contract's
health check.

## How to use

### Shape and nodes

- **Shape presets** – switch the graph without resetting raster colors or 3D material choices.
- **Namche Loop** – the current default mark.
- **Classic Mark** – the exact approved legacy vector with its editable five-node graph.

- **Add a node** – click an empty editable cell (inner 3×3 by default, or any of 25 cells when outer-cell authoring is enabled).
- **Select a node** – click it; size, radius, and delete controls become active.
- **Resize** – choose S, M, L, or XL, or set an exact **Radius** with the slider.
- **Nudge position** – with a node selected, use arrow keys (1 px) or Shift+arrow (5 px) to offset it off the cell center.
- **Move between cells** – Alt+drag or Shift+drag a node onto another empty cell.
- **Remove** – right-click a node, or select it and press Delete / Backspace.

### Connections

- **Connect** – drag from one node to another to toggle an edge.
- **Select a connection** – click the line between two nodes.
- **Customize selected connection** – in Metaball mode, select a join, then under Style turn on
  **Customize selected connection** to override **Neck width** and **Pinch** for that join only.
  Blur and Contrast stay global. Turn the toggle off to follow Style defaults again.
- **Remove connection** – right-click the line, or select it and press Delete.

### Metaball tuning (Metaball mode)

All sliders show numeric readouts and accept typed values:

- **Neck width** – capsule thickness before blur (0.10–1.00). Also available per connection.
- **Blur** – Gaussian blur amount (`gooStd`); higher = softer, wider joins. Global only.
- **Contrast** – alpha cutoff (`gooThreshold`); higher = sharper waist, tighter neck. Global only.
- **Pinch / merge** – morphs bridges from a thick barbell tube (0) toward a classic
  pinched metaball (1): tubes fade out and blur takes over so the silhouette dips
  inward between circles. Also boosts effective blur as tubes fade. Per-connection
  **Pinch** overrides tube scale for that join only (blur boost stays global).

### 2D appearance and authoring

- **Mark** – controls the flat 2D mark color.
- **Namche raster** – turns the complete raster background on or off. When enabled,
  its outer cells, inner cells, and background colors can be edited together.
- **Allow nodes in outer cells** – expands authoring from the inner 3×3 to all 25 cells.
- **Form / Graph** – Form is the actual mark and enables SVG/PNG export; Graph is
  an authoring view for understanding and editing its node network.

### Motion

Choose one loop from the compact **Motion** selector, stop it explicitly, or play
the one-shot **Grow once** reveal. **Allow necks to break** only applies while a
loop is active.

### 3D view

Switch the **2D / 3D** toggle in the header to see the same nodes and connections
rendered as a real, camera-orbitable metaball isosurface (via `THREE.MarchingCubes`)
instead of the flat SVG blur trick.

- Nodes and connections are still authored in **2D** – the 3D view is a live showcase
  of the current document, not a separate editor. Switch back to 2D to keep editing.
- **Neck width**, **Blur**, **Contrast**, and **Pinch / merge** in the Style section
  keep driving the shape live in 3D, exactly as they do in 2D.
- **Material** – available only in 3D. Choose an Organic PBR stand-in or a Liquid
  transmission material and its environment (see below).
- **Fine tune liquid** – keeps the detailed transmission, caustic, wave, rim, and
  optical controls collapsed until they are needed.
- **Surface sampling** – an opt-in advanced overlay. It is off by default so the
  first 3D render does not allocate and animate thousands of points and spheres.
- **AI material render** – captures the current object and camera as the locked
  shape reference, combines it with a generic material direction and optional
  reference image, then calls the configured image model through the protected
  server route. Shape fidelity and material influence are independent controls.
  The result is a rendered study, not a modified mesh or UV texture map.
- **Export GLB** – downloads the isosurface plus Principled-friendly material
  params (color, roughness, metalness, transmission, IOR, clearcoat, sheen, …).
- **Export for Blender** – downloads `metaball-blender-handoff.zip` for Blender
  MCP: `mesh.glb`, live `obj-preview.png`, `HANDOFF.md` (universal
  SurfaceDriver + VERIFY LOOP prompt), and a reference image when available —
  bundled for Harz+Moos / Fels / Schaum, or your own attached image for **any**
  material. Drop the zip into chat with Blender MCP open; follow
  [docs/blender-texture-transfer-prompt.md](docs/blender-texture-transfer-prompt.md).
- **Attach material image** – in AI material render, attach any image as the
  material/lighting look target. The same reference is reused by the optional
  Blender handoff.
- Drag to orbit the camera; scroll/pinch to zoom. Raster and flat mark controls are
  hidden in 3D; material controls are hidden in 2D so the two appearance systems
  cannot conflict.

#### Materials (live stand-ins → Blender)

All presets are plain `MeshPhysicalMaterial` stand-ins for the live 3D view —
not in-browser hair, displacement, or true SSS. Blender finish is always the
universal transfer prompt driven by the reference image (bundled or attached).

| Preset        | Live preview                           | Bundled ref (optional) |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Harz+Moos** | Amber resin (transmission + clearcoat) | Yes                    |
| **Fels**      | Cool matte stone                       | Yes                    |
| **Schaum**    | Peach satin (light transmission)       | Yes                    |

Workflow: author shape in 2D → check form in 3D → **Export for Blender** →
import in Blender → follow `HANDOFF.md` /
[docs/blender-texture-transfer-prompt.md](docs/blender-texture-transfer-prompt.md).

### History & persistence

- **Undo / Redo** – toolbar buttons or Cmd/Ctrl+Z / Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z.
- **Autosave** – your work is saved to localStorage automatically.
- **Export JSON / Import JSON** – share or back up the full document (nodes, edges, per-edge overrides, colors, metaball settings).

### Export

- **Export SVG** – flattened to a real vector `<path>` in Form mode (compatible with Figma/Illustrator).
- **Export PNG** – choose scale (1×, 2×, 4×, 8×).
- **Copy SVG** – copies the flattened SVG string to the clipboard.
- **Export GLB** – (3D view) downloads the isosurface as a binary glTF for Blender.
- **Export for Blender** – (3D view) zip handoff for Blender MCP (mesh + preview +
  staged prompt; a bundled organic material ref or your attached reference image).
- **Mark only** – transparent background, mark only (no raster).
- **Advanced export** – optional controls for the flattened path:
  - **Export preview overlay** – dashed outline of the flattened export path on canvas.
  - **Flatten detail** – simplify epsilon for export path smoothness.
  - **Flatten res.** – raster resolution multiplier for sharper exports.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key                | Action                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Arrow keys         | Nudge selected node (1 px)         |
| Shift + arrow      | Nudge selected node (5 px)         |
| 1 / 2 / 3 / 4      | Set size S / M / L / XL            |
| Delete / Backspace | Remove selected node or connection |
| Escape             | Deselect                           |
| Cmd/Ctrl+Z         | Undo                               |
| Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z   | Redo                               |

The reusable viewer itself lives in the sibling `renderer/` workspace as
`@namche/metaball-react`. The editor's ordinary material view consumes it;
Liquid, surface sampling, and Blender/export hooks stay in the Studio adapter.
See [`../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## How the two render modes share one model

Nodes and edges are authored once. **Graph** mode draws each edge as a thick
round-capped line plus a circle per node. **Metaball** mode draws the same node
circles plus a tube along each edge, all inside an SVG goo filter
(`feGaussianBlur` + `feColorMatrix` threshold) so connected shapes fuse
organically. Export flattens the same field into a smooth SVG path via marching
squares.

Grid geometry and 2D flattening come from the repository's
`@namche/metaball` workspace. `src/lib/model.ts` only adds studio-specific
look, material, liquid, and surface-sampler state.
